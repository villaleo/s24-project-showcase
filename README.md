# W+IT Summer '24 Project Showcase

This summer, I had the wonderful opportunity to teach members at the Digital
NEST about Web Development.

We focused on front end web development to create websites from scratch,
utilizing important tools and software such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, and
JavaScript.
